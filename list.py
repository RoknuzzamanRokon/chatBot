l = ["Islam is a monotheistic religion that began in the early 7th century in Mecca, a city in present-day Saudi Arabia. The foundation of Islam is the belief in one God (Allah in Arabic), who is eternal, self-sufficient, and without comparison. Muslims believe that God has communicated his will through prophets, with the final revelation given to the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nThe life, teachings, and practices of Muhammad, as documented in the Quran and Hadiths, form the basis of Islamic faith and societal structure. The Quran, considered by followers as the verbatim word of God, contains the doctrinal, ethical, socio-political, and religious codes that Muslims adhere to.\n\nThe Shahada, or declaration of faith, summarises the basic theology of Islam; “There is no God but Allah, and Muhammad is His Messenger.” This proclamation asserts the monotheism of God and the prophethood of Muhammad. \n\nIslam espouses five fundamental “Pillars” that dictate the life of a practicing Muslim. These are the profession of faith (Shahada), five daily prayers (Salat), almsgiving (Zakat), fasting during the month of Ramadan (Sawm), and pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). \n\nThe ethical system of Islam, accomplished through submission to God's will, promotes charity, honesty, and justice. Muslims believe in life after death (akhirah), with one's actions in life determining their fate in the hereafter. \n\nIslam has two major branches, Sunni and Shia, each with its own interpretation of Muhammad’s succession. While holding the same foundational beliefs, differences in political and religious views have led to tumultuous conflicts throughout history. Other Islamic denominations include Sufism, a mystical-ascetic form of Islam that seeks a direct and personal experience of the divine.\n\nMuslims place high importance on family and community (Ummah). Islamic criminal law, called Sharia, is a system of religious law that governs primarily personal status issues such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and child custody.\n\nIslam is more than just a religion; it is an all-encompassing way of life that governs all facets of life—moral, spiritual, social, political, economical—based on God’s guidance. It seeks to create a balanced and just society through its teachings. The ideal society, according to Islam, obeys God's laws referred to as the ‘straight path.’\n\nIslam has been and continues to be a significant force in the world, culturally, politically, and socially. Today, it is one of the world’s largest religions, with more than a billion followers globally known as Muslims.\n\nIn summary, Islam is a monotheistic religion that advocates for submission and obedience to God. Its teachings as documented in the Quran and Hadiths provide a guideline for personal conduct, societal laws, and moral ethos. Through belief in one God and living righteously, Muslims aspire for spiritual fulfillment in life and in the hereafter.", "The concept of Tawheed, or the Oneness of Allah, lies at the very heart of Islam. It represents the pivotal point of faith, around which all other beliefs and practices revolve. The term Tawheed comes from the Arabic root word 'wahd', which means to unify, to make one, or to ascertain oneness. In the context of Islamic belief, Tawheed refers to the oneness and uniqueness of Allah in every aspect, negating any form of polytheism or idolatry.\n\nTawheed is essentially the Islamic belief in monotheism, i.e., believing in the existence of a singular and absolute deity who is the originator and creator of everything in existence. This means that there cannot be any other god or entity share in His divine attributes or powers. Allah is unique in His essence, attributes, actions, laws and commands.\n\nTawheed is generally divided into three categories: Tawheed al-Rububiyya, Tawheed al-Asma wa'l-Sifat, and Tawheed al-Ibadah.\n\nTawheed al-Rububiyya, points to the belief in Allah as the absolute and only ruler and creator of the universe, the master of all, the sustainer of life, and the one who causes life and death. There are no intermediaries in His creation, and no partners in His dominance.\n\nTawheed al-Asma wa’l-Sifat, refers to the oneness in the names and attributes of Allah. Muslims believe that all names and descriptions of Allah mentioned in the Quran are unique to Him alone. This aspect of Tawheed highlights the ultimate perfection of Allah and implies that humans should not attempt to comprehend the nature or form of Allah, as our limited human faculties cannot grasp His might and glory.\n\nTawheed al-Ibadah, this is the oneness of worshipping Allah alone, ascribing no partner with Him in worship. This form of Tawheed emphasizes that all prayers, supplications, sacrifices, vowing and other forms of worship are solely for Allah. Assigning any of these actions to another entity or person is considered shirk, the greatest sin in Islam.\n\nThe importance of Tawheed in Islam cannot be overstated. It forms the core of the Islamic faith and shapes the worldview of a Muslim. It is the first pillar of Islam and the foundation of the religion. It is the first message brought by all the prophets and messengers sent by Allah, from Adam to Muhammad (peace be upon them all). Adherence to Tawheed leads to paradise and defiance leads to hellfire. It also promotes equality among human beings, as all are equal before the One God.\n\nIn conclusion, Tawheed, the oneness of Allah, is the most significant concept in Islam. It exalts the uniqueness and singularity of Allah, encompassing faith in His sole dominion, the exclusiveness of His attributes, and the singularity of His deserving worship. It establishes the relationship between humankind and their Creator, giving purpose to life and instilling a sense of responsibility and accountability for one’s actions.", "The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH - Peace be Upon Him) is the most significant figure in Islam, revered as the last and final prophet of God (Allah).\n\nMuhammad was born in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, in 570 AD. He belonged to the Quraysh tribe, which was a powerful and respected tribe in Mecca. Muhammad's father died before his birth, and his mother died when he was just six, leaving him an orphan. He was subsequently raised by his grandfather and later his uncle.\n\nAs Muhammad grew older, he became renowned for his truthfulness, generosity, and sincerity, earning the title 'Al-Amin' (the trust-worthy). He spent several years as a merchant and was well-respected in the community. At the age of 25, he married Khadija, a wealthy widow, and they had four daughters and two sons together.\n\nAt the age of 40, Muhammad began receiving revelations from God through the angel Gabriel. These revelations, which continued for 23 years, are collectively known as the Quran, the holy book of Islam.\n\nAt first, Muhammad was instructed to preach only to his family and close friends. However, three years after his first revelation, he was commanded by God to begin delivering his message publicly. Muhammad preached monotheism and righteousness, challenging the polytheistic belief systems of Mecca's society. This led to significant opposition and persecution from the Quraysh tribe and other Meccan leaders.\n\nIn 622, Muhammad and his followers migrated to the city of Medina to escape ongoing persecution. This event, known as the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic lunar calendar. \n\nIn Medina, Muhammad served as a religious leader and statesman, implementing a constitution that guaranteed rights and duties of all citizens regardless of their religion. During this time, various battles were fought against the Meccans. These culminated in the Conquest of Mecca in 630, where Muhammad forgave his enemies, establishing a significant precedent for mercy and forgiveness in Islam.\n\nMuhammad continued to spread Islam through his teachings and examples, emphasizing the importance of faith, prayer, charity, fasting, and pilgrimage. His life served as an embodiment of the Quranic teachings, providing a model for ethical and moral conduct.\n\nIn 632, during his farewell pilgrimage to Mecca, Muhammad delivered his last sermon, highlighting the principles of equality, justice, and human rights. Shortly after, he fell ill and passed away. Even after his death, Muhammad's teachings continue to guide more than a billion Muslims worldwide. His life and prophethood played a pivotal role in shaping Islamic civilization and continues to hold a profound influence on global history and culture.", 'The Quran, also spelled as Qur\'an, is the holy book of Islam. Described as the "Word of Allah" delivered to the Prophet Muhammad through the Angel Gabriel, the Quran is considered by Muslims as the ultimate source of spiritual guidance and the terrestrial connection to the divine.\n\nSpread across 114 chapters or suras, the Quran encompasses over 6,000 verses, each carrying its particular spiritual, moral, or legal message. The initial revelation reportedly took place in 610 AD in a cave named Hira near Mecca, and sporadically continued in the subsequent 23 years, some verses revealed in Mecca and others in Medina.\n\nAs fundamental religious texts, the Quran is written in classical Arabic. Muslims worldwide, irrespective of their mother tongue, strive to learn and understand Arabic to read the Quran in its original format and appreciate the lyrical beauty and consummate eloquence it\'s known for. Reading and reciting the Quran is an integral part of Muslim worship, and significant emphasis is given to Tajweed, the proper phonetic pronunciation of Quranic verses.\n\nThematically, the Quran outlines the quintessence of monotheism. It emphasizes the omnipresence of a single divine entity, Allah, and the relegation of Prophet Muhammad as the last messenger in the lineage of prophets like Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Christ. Thus, it demarcates the line between the absolute and unyielding monotheism of Islam and the perceived polytheistic misinterpretations of Christianity and Judaism.\n\nThe Quran\'s contents are diverse yet interconnected, touching upon various spheres of human life. It elaborates on matters related to faith, ethics, social justice, and human relations, offering Muslims comprehensive guidelines for leading a balanced worldly and spiritual life. The Quran also recounts numerous stories from past civilizations and prophets and warns against the pitfalls of disobedience, corruption, and immorality.\n\nThe Quran upholds the virtues of patience, humility, charity, and compassion. It advocates for justice and fairness, promotes scientific inquiry, and encourages the pursuit of knowledge. It emphatically condemns oppression, falsehood, and decadence. It also provides a legal framework, known as Sharia, guiding civil, criminal, domestic, and economic aspects of a Muslim\'s life.\n\nDespite popular misconceptions, the Quran strongly endorses peace and condemns violence. It exhorts Muslims to coexist harmoniously with people of other faiths and propagate Islam through wisdom and courteous dialogue. In certain contexts, it sanctions warfare, but strictly as a defensive measure against oppression or religious persecution.\n\nThe Quran concludes with a sura that succinctly encapsulates its message- a plea for divine protection and guidance against the malicious and deceitful influences.\n\nThe Quran is not merely a book for Muslims; it is a scripture that guides them to lead a life of righteousness, wisdom, and peace. It\'s seen as the divine testament of faith, a mirror to the metaphysical truth, an arbiter in dilemmas, and above all, a means to attain closeness to Allah. It serves as the spiritual cornerstone of a Muslim\'s life, a beacon that guides their every action, thought, and decision.', 'Islam, a monotheistic religion grounded in the teachings of Prophet Muhammad, is hallmarked by Five Pillars, consecrating the framework of a Muslim\'s life. These entail Shahada (Faith), Salat (Prayer), Zakat (Charity), Sawm (Fasting), and Hajj (Pilgrimage). \n\nThe first Pillar, Shahada, imparts the heart of Islamic faith: "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is his messenger." The affirmation is the foundation of a Muslim\'s belief, implying acknowledging Allah as the sole deity and Muhammad as his prophet. It is a simple oath, stating a Muslim\'s devout submission to Allah and accepting the finality and absolute authority of Prophet Muhammad\'s teachings.\n\nThe second Pillar, Salat, prescribes Muslims to observe five daily prayers. Each prayer consists of specific physical and recital repetitions. This ritual allows Muslims to maintain a constant connection with Allah. Prayers are performed at dawn (Fajr), midday (Zuhr), afternoon (Asr), sunset (Maghrib), and night (Isha). It serves to strengthen believers\' faith and reminds them of their obligations and accountability to Allah.\n\nThe third pillar, Zakat, or almsgiving, commands Muslims to redress economic disparities by assisting the less fortunate. By fulfilling this obligation, Muslims purify their wealth, foster social harmony, and promote communal solidarity. It is customarily 2.5% of a person\'s yearly savings. Zakat instills empathy and generosity, discourages greed, and fosters socioeconomic equality.\n\nThe fourth pillar, Sawm, prescribes fasting in the holy month of Ramadan from dawn until dusk. Fasting reinforces self-discipline and self-control, deepening empathy for the less fortunate. It is not merely abstaining from food and water, but also from sinful speech and actions. It is a time of heightened spirituality, introspection, and greater commitment to moral and ethical conduct.\n\nThe fifth and final pillar, Hajj, necessitates every able Muslim to undertake a pilgrimage to Mecca, the holy city, at least once in their lifetime, provided they have the financial means and physical ability. This pilgrimage is a large-scale enactment of unity and equality when Muslims, regardless of race or social status, come together to worship Allah in a single place. It signifies devotion, humility, and the cyclicality of life and death.\n\nIn essence, the Five Pillars of Islam provide an ethical code and spiritual guidance, affirming a Muslim\'s faith and devotion. They serve as a constant reminder of the relationship between the individual and Allah, cultivating moral values and inspiring life lived in accordance with Allah\'s teachings. These pillars create a balanced, well-rounded Muslim character, fostering coherence between faith and action. They lead to a spiritually fulfilling life, social harmony, and unity in diversity among the entire Muslim community. The Five Pillars thus epitomize the essence and spirit of Islam.', 'Prayer (Salat) is one of the five pillars of Islam and is considered an act of physical, mental, and spiritual worship towards Allah. It is an obligatory duty upon every Muslim to perform it five times a day, each prayer composed of different units of standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting down.\n\nSalat has been shaped by the Prophet Muhammad whose prayers were a reflection of direct communication and deep connection with Allah. His method of praying became the model for all Muslims to follow. There are five daily prayers: Fajr (pre-dawn), Dhuhr (noon), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (after sunset), and Isha (night). Each prayer comprises a specific number of units (rakats), and each has unique benefits spiritually and mentally.\n\nThe Salat begins with "Takbeer", the affirmation of the greatness of Allah, followed by the recitation of the Qur\'an, bowing and prostration, each representing a different state of reverence towards Allah. Salat is performed facing the Ka\'bah in Mecca, the holiest site in Islam, signifying unity and oneness among Muslims regardless of their geographical location.\n\nSalat is more than just a ritual. It is a medium through which Muslims engage with their Creator. It\'s a time for reflection, self-discipline, and mindfulness. Praying helps Muslims to maintain spiritual purity, achieve inner peace, and strengthen their faith. Salat also reinforces ethical and moral values, acting as a reminder to abstain from wrongful acts. \n\nAnother significant aspect of Salat is the communal aspect. Although the Salah can be performed individually, it is highly recommended to pray in congregation. A communal Prayer consolidates the ties of brotherhood and unity among Muslims. Friday prayers, known as Salat al-Jumu’ah, are a notable example of this collective worship, where Muslims gather at the mosque to pray and listen to an Islamic lecture, reinforcing the sense of unity and communal identity.\n\nThrough Salat, Muslims are also reminded of the principle of equality in Islam. In prayer, all Muslims, regardless of their social, racial, or economic background are required to stand shoulder to shoulder, symbolizing that every person is equal in the eyes of Allah. \n\nThe benefits of Salat are transcendent. It serves as a source of comfort and guidance in times of distress, a pathway of repentance, an avenue to express gratitude, and contentment in times of prosperity. It brings about a discipline in life allowing a person to manage their time more effectively. Salat in its spiritual depths creates a bond between the Creator and the created.\n\nIn conclusion, Salat in Islam plays an extremely fundamental role in a Muslim\'s life. It is not an empty ritual but a comprehensive system designed to nurture their belief in Allah and keep their moral and spiritual wellbeing intact. Salat is a constant reminder of the purpose of life, fostering a sense of gratitude, humility, and submission towards the one and only Creator. Hence, it is rightly said that Prayer or Salat is the pulse of life in Islam.']
